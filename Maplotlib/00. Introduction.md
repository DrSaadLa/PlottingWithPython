# Matplotlib Introduction

 - **Matplotlib** is a Python library for data visualization, and it was created by John Hunter try to replicate MatLab's plotting capabilities in Python. 
 
 - **Matplotlib is a popular plotting library for Python**
 - **It is similar to MATLAB plotting interface** 
 
 - It is an excellent 2D and 3D graphics library for generating scientific and publication-quality figures. 

- Matplotlib allows you to create reproducible figures programmatically.
- Generally easy to get started for simple plots.
- It produces high-quality output in many formats.
- **It gives the control over every aspect of a figure, in other words, it is very customizable** .

- **Matplotlib works with numpy arrays and pandas dataframes**
   
### Matplotlib Documentation

- The official Matplotlib web page [website](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) is very rich of information and it is worth visiting if you want to learn this library in depth.

### Installing Matplotlib 
 
**Installing Matplotlib**: you can use either **PIP** or **conda** manager to install **matplotlib** so you can use it:

```python 
# Using pip
pip install -U matplotlib

# Using Conda
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

## Importing 

```python
import matplotlib as mpl
print(dir(mpl))
```

```python
print(mpl._version)
```


```python
# Check matplotlib version
# -----------------------
import matplotlib as mpl
print(mpl.__version__)

# Check the docstring 
print(mpl.__doc__)
```

    3.5.3
    
    An object-oriented plotting library.
    
    A procedural interface is provided by the companion pyplot module,
    which may be imported directly, e.g.::
    
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    or using ipython::
    
        ipython
    
    at your terminal, followed by::
    
        In [1]: %matplotlib
        In [2]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    at the ipython shell prompt.
    
    For the most part, direct use of the object-oriented library is encouraged when
    programming; pyplot is primarily for working interactively.  The exceptions are
    the pyplot functions `.pyplot.figure`, `.pyplot.subplot`, `.pyplot.subplots`,
    and `.pyplot.savefig`, which can greatly simplify scripting.
    
    Modules include:
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.axes`
            The `~.axes.Axes` class.  Most pyplot functions are wrappers for
            `~.axes.Axes` methods.  The axes module is the highest level of OO
            access to the library.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.figure`
            The `.Figure` class.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.artist`
            The `.Artist` base class for all classes that draw things.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.lines`
            The `.Line2D` class for drawing lines and markers.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.patches`
            Classes for drawing polygons.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.text`
            The `.Text` and `.Annotation` classes.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.image`
            The `.AxesImage` and `.FigureImage` classes.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.collections`
            Classes for efficient drawing of groups of lines or polygons.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.colors`
            Color specifications and making colormaps.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.cm`
            Colormaps, and the `.ScalarMappable` mixin class for providing color
            mapping functionality to other classes.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.ticker`
            Calculation of tick mark locations and formatting of tick labels.
    
        :mod:`matplotlib.backends`
            A subpackage with modules for various GUI libraries and output formats.
    
    The base matplotlib namespace includes:
    
        `~matplotlib.rcParams`
            Default configuration settings; their defaults may be overridden using
            a :file:`matplotlibrc` file.
    
        `~matplotlib.use`
            Setting the Matplotlib backend.  This should be called before any
            figure is created, because it is not possible to switch between
            different GUI backends after that.
    
    Matplotlib was initially written by John D. Hunter (1968-2012) and is now
    developed and maintained by a host of others.
    
    Occasionally the internal documentation (python docstrings) will refer

### Matplotlib APIs

 - Maplotlib provides two Application Porogramming Interfaces (APIs):
     - A Procedural API
     - An object-oriented API (there will be whole tutorials about this type of API)
     
 - These interfaces are provided by the module `matplotlib.pyplot`. 
 - It is strongly recommend to only use the object-oriented approach.
 - The procedural API is used to generate simple plots. 

### The pyplot module

- Matplotlib has many submodules, but the most used submodule is **pyplot** which can be imported as **plt** by convention:

 - **Pyplot** submodule of **Matplotlib** is a simplified interface that gives a convenient set of commands that allows us to create simple and complex plots.
 
 - **pyplot** is has a procedural API and an Object Oriented API.  
 - This submodule does not require you to know about the innards of the system. 
 - You can effectively schematize all kinds of data by learning properly the **pyplot** module from matplotlib. 
 
 - **By convention, pyplot is imported as plt** like this:
 
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```


 - You can check the content of this submodule by running the next command:
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot
print(dir(pyplot))
```

### Inline plotting

  - We can use the next command in order to see the plots inside jupyter notebook. 
  
 ```python 
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
# Environment Settup
# ------------------

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

%matplotlib inline
```
